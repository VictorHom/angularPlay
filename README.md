# Angular For Quick Set up
I read tutorials and books on different web technologies. As I follow the examples, I often want to type up the examples for practice. However, it becomes difficult for a couple of reasons:
- the examples don't come with the bare template to work with. It's often no code to download or the full solution.
- With the move toward ES6, a lot of material is still in ES5. How can you practice ES6 when all the examples are in ES5?

The goal of this repo is to have a bare minimum structure for people to play with Angular 1.5 while practicing it with ES6. To allow this, I am using Babel for transpiling. In addition, Browserify is used with Gulp for task running -- all your changes will cause a reload of the bundled javascript files.

# Technologies:
The main technologies to learn from this file structure:
- ES6
- Angular 1.5
- Browserify
- Gulp

Have fun learning!
